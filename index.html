<p>I know you're coming here.</p>

<p>I know the site is broken.</p>

<p>I mean really, like a thousand of your guys a month --- to a now broken thing that inspired twitch ...</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I'm fixing it.</p>

<p>Things have been moved to a new server and I'm updating the code.  I'm writing this on June 23, 2016.</p>

<p>Want to help? Trust me - you don't. This code was written in like 3 days in 2009 while I had a full-time job - mostly in the middle of the night. Why do you think it's been broken for like 4 years? Ok, my laziness has a lot to do with that, ok right.</p>
