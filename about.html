<h2>And then, the internet became boring.</h2>
<p>
Up until now, it's always been ok to ignore the minority. 
This has to change as consumer habits rapidly diversify.
</p>
<p>
As the fragmentation increases, dynamic consumer 
driven classifiers should be cultivated through collective 
experiences that encourage holistic engagement.
</p>
<p>
This is my first large scale experiment in trying to assert a renaissance
for a new internet experience. Thanks for partaking and I'm glad you 
can join me in this adventure.

Sincerely,
