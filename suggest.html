<h1>Suggest</h1>
<p>Some guidelines to be thematically consistent are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Every Song Must Have a Video from the era of the song!</b></li>
  <li>The ideal years are between 1969 and 1989.</li>
  <li>Interviews and non-english language songs are also welcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you type in the artist and song, there will be a result below that
will show you whether it's been added already or not.
</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Cure has audio muted in the US (240p will play it), so unfortunately, they are out until I can get around to coding a feature that will force a quality on muted tracks like this.</li>
</ul>
