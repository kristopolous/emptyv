<h1>About</h1>
<p>mt80s.com plays videos from third-party sources like youtube and metacafe in a preprogrammed sequence. The purpose is to emulate people's perception of the programming of MTV from the 80s so that they feel like they are watching the station in its beloved, but unfortunately abandoned, format.

<h1>Suggest</h1>
<p>Some guidelines to be thematically consistent are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Every Song Must Have a Video from the era of the song!</b>. TOTP (Top of The Pops, a British 80s Show) is discouraged.</li>
  <li>The ideal years are between 1980 and 1986, but much earlier songs like David Bowies' Space Oddity (1969) are great.
  </li>
  <li>The priority of genres,
    <ol>
      <li> New-wave, Alternative Rock, and General Pop
      <li> Metal and Punk
      <li> Electro, Pre-Gangsta Rap, and Hip-Hop
      <li> Non-English Language equivalencies of the stuff above
      <li> Interviews with musicians
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
As you type in the artist and song, there will be a result below that
will show you whether it's been added already or not.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Cure has audio muted in the US (240p will play it), so unfortunately, they are out until I can get around to coding a feature that will force a quality on muted tracks like this.</li>
</ul>
