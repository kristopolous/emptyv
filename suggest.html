<h1>Report A Dead Song</h1>
<p>Did you just see blank-ness for 3 minutes or so? Yeah, sorry about that, tell me what the song was and I'll get right on it</p>

<h1>Suggest A Song</h1>
<p>Here's some general guidelines to be thematically consistent with the vision of the project:
<ul>
  <li><b>Every Song Must Have a Video from the era of the song!</b>. So Morrissey doing "Hand In Glove" in 2009 is awesome, really; but it doesn't belong here. Additionally, TOTP (top of the pops, a british 80s show), is discouraged; it's not mt80s enough.</li>
  <li>The ideal years are between 1980 and 1985, but much earlier songs like David Bowies' Space Oddity (1969) are acceptable; 1989 is pushing it, unless it is stylistically old and "thought" to be from the 80s. 
  <em>For instance, Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus and The B-52's Love Shack both "belong" in the 80s although they are both from 1989.</em>
  </li>
  <li>The priority of genres are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li> New-wave or Alternative Rock
      <li> General Pop (think Go Gos)
      <li> Metal or Punk
      <li> Electro
      <li> Pre-Gangsta Rap and Hip-Hop (NWA is thematically inconsistent)
      <li> Italo Disco or EuroPop
      <li> Interviews with musicians (Such as the drummer from U2)
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
As you type in the artist and song, there will be a result below that
will show you whether it's been added already or not.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The Cure has audio muted in the US (240p will play it), so unfortunately, they are out until I can get around to coding a feature that will force a quality on muted tracks like this.</li>
</ol>
